## ⚙️ Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file (only needed for local dev):

```env
PORT=8080
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_NAME=inventory_db
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
JWT_SECRET=supersecretkey
```

## 🐳 Docker Setup
Start app and database:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
App will be live at: http://localhost:8080

Swagger docs at: http://localhost:8080/api-docs

## 🧪 How to Use in Postman

1. Open **Postman**
2. Click **Import** → Select the provided `postman_collection.json` file
3. Use the `Register` and `Login` endpoints to create a user and log in
4. After logging in, you'll receive an `access_token` in the response:
   ```json
   {
     "access_token": "your-jwt-token"
   }
  
5. Copy the access_token

6. In Postman, go to the Collections tab → Variables, and paste the token into the token variable:

```bash
token = <your-jwt-token>
```
7. Now you can test the protected routes like:
```bash
  POST /products

  PUT /products/:id/quantity

  GET /products
```

```
